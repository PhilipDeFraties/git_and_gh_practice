I am an obsessive rock climber.
I train 3-4 days a week in the gym and climb outside in golden as often as
possible.
The climbing community has collectively decided that during the quarantine,
climbing areas should remain empty to keep from spreading the virus further.
The climbing gyms have also been closed.
A few months before the quarantine I had ruptured a tendon in my finger and
had to fully rest with no climbing to recover.
I have not climbed in over 3 months :(.
